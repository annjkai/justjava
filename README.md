# justjava
Creating and modifying the Udacity JustJava app.

I independently added the following features:
* an additional topping (caramel)
* three optional flavor shots (vanilla, caramel, hazelnut). These checkboxes function the same as the toppings.
* a description of the base coffee as I felt the app was a bit naked.

I also updated the order summary to reflect the additions. Unfortunately my poor customers  will get the worst coffee ever as I as yet have no way to customize individual drinks - everyone gets one of whatever is selected! I would like to come back at some point to this code to figure out how to make this happen. In addition, I updated the prices to feel a bit more realistic.
