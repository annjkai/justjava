# justjava
Creating and modifying the Udacity JustJava app.

I independently added the following features:
* an additional topping (caramel)
* three optional flavor shots (vanilla, caramel, hazelnut). These checkboxes function the same as the toppings.

I also updated the order summary to reflect the additions. Unfortunately my poor customers  will get the worst coffee ever as I as yet have no way to customize individual drinks - everyone gets one of whatever is selected! I would like to come back at some point to this code to figure out how to make this happen.
